Ayan Bishnu,Good Mobile (If you have budget go for it. don't buy to impress or on EMI (not worth it)),1.0 out of 5 stars,"As I was aware that what I need and what I was paying for, I needed a quality mobile with best hardware and software combination.I need the OS to be clean without any bloatware which I got.I don't play games. For moderate use of Social media, whatsapp, youtube, audible (audio books), music while exercising, Battery life is around 2 days or sometimes more than 2 days. If you are a gamer or use mobile a lot you might need to charge your mobile everyday.Camera is good. So far the pictures I took the quality is good.Not explore the processor's capacity yet but Never hanged or never will for me (not a heavy user so won't be a problem)."
rs1008,Highlight- Superv Camera and 120hz refresh rate,5.0 out of 5 stars,
Dinesh,Beast!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I would prefer this over S24 ultra. Used both phones and impressed by this phone. Yes I agree s24 ultra had few more features but in terms of quality 15 pro max wins. And camera quality is far better than s24ultra. But it differs on a customer‚Äôs choice.

Rhitabrata D.,Just amazing!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just amazing product. Actually I like to purchase online products but as it's so expensive, I tried to purchase from local store in Barasat but they told me 8 thousand more than online price (Only phone's price)üòÄ even without charger, screen protector and back cover.I got it on online with everything only ‚Çπ1,52,000. Although it was a little difficult to buy, as you know it is not easy to transfer the higher amounts within short time. üòÄHowever, Thanks to Amazon team and specially thanks to my IDOL ""Steve Jobs"" üôèü§ó"
kiran singh,pathetic beterry life and call conferencing is nopt working,5.0 out of 5 stars,"iphone 15pro max ios worst pro max I purchased. I already have 13 and 14 pro max, Time to switch to Samsung. The screeenshot you see shows 85% baterrey charge but it has been only 5 min after i made a full charge of the phone"
kiran singh,Incremental Upgrade with Enhanced Camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently upgraded to the Apple 15 Pro Max, and while the enhanced camera is undoubtedly impressive, but I feel that it falls short of delivering a truly groundbreaking experience. If you're already using the 13 pro or 14 Pro, there seems to be little incentive to make the leap.The camera improvements are noteworthy, capturing detail and clarity like never before. However, beyond this feature, the 15 Pro Max doesn't offer a significant leap in terms of innovation. Personally, I find the Pro versions more manageable in hand, and the Max variant, although boasting a larger screen, can be a bit unwieldy.In essence, the 15 Pro Max is a solid device with a stellar camera, but for those already enjoying the perks of the previous Pro models, the upgrade might not feel as compelling."
Sameer I,iPhone 15 pro max take photos only 24 MP while company showing 48 MP,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Camera setting not available, so photos not better than Samsung m34, likely Caller tune should not set, call record not available. Should not connect to laptop. Download space not available"
